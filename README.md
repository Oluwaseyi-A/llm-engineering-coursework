# LLM Engineering Coursework

This repository contains my hands-on practice for exercises and projects from the [LLM Engineering: Master AI, Large Language Models & Agents](https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models) course on Udemy.

The forked course repository is available at [Oluwaseyi-A/llm_engineering](https://github.com/Oluwaseyi-A/llm_engineering)
